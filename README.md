# The list of companies

The list itself is in [content/list.yaml](content/list.yaml)

# Why
The pandemic has shown what's possible with a better work/life balance. Many enlightened companies were doing it even before COVID.

<br>

### But I don't mind working 5 days a week!
Then by all means, keep doing that!

However, there's no need to try to keep the goal of a shorter week from the rest of us - we can coexist! 

The set of companies that work at least 4 days a week includes companies that work 4 days a week and companies that work 5 days a week. There's no need to oppose a 4 day week - you can keep working 5 days as much as you want, whether the company is on the list or not!

<br>

### Oh boy, I don't know, this seems like a slippery slope. Why not work even less? Why not 3 day weeks?
I couldn't have said it better myself! And while I doubt we'll be getting a 3 day week soon, the slope isn't slippery enough for my taste so I'm lubricating it with this site.

Shouldn't we generally be trying to work less and enjoy our lives more? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

# Criteria
Companies that are on the list have a standard work week of **no more than** 32 hours. No one is **expected** to work more than that. Typically this means relinquishing Friday to the weekend, where it rightfully belongs. 

"Full time" at these companies would be considered 32 hours/week, "part time" would be less than 32 hours/week.

## What doesn't count

|||
|---|---|
|"We offer the flexibility to work whenever you want, as long as you get your work done."|This is great! But doesn't necessarily imply a 32 hour week.|
|"You can opt to work 32 hours and get paid 80%"|No|
|4 days a week x 10 hours a day ("4 10s")|No|
|80 hours every 9 days, typically meaning every other Friday off ("9 80")|No|
