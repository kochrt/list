    Hey, thanks for reaching out.  
    
    I'm not looking for new opportunities right now, though I do know that I want the next place I work at to be on thelistofcompanies.com. And I bet I wouldn't be the only one!

    If your status on the list changes, feel free to hit me up again!

    Thanks,

    Hi!

    I'd love to chat, though to be upfront, I am much more interested in companies that are on thelistofcompanies.com (companies that have a four day work week). Wink, wink.

    Best,

    Wow, I finally get to use this canned response from thelistofcompanies.com since your company is actually on the list!

    I'd love to talk - I'm available Monday through Thursday.
